# Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment based on JavaScript syntax that runs outside of the browser. One of the main characteristics of Node.js is that it doesn't require compilation to run, unlike other programming languages such as Java or C#.

Node.js has become a fundamental part of web development, allowing us to enhance our applications with non-web tools while maintaining a syntax similar to JavaScript, something familiar to web developers.

## What Can I Do with Node.js?

As a runtime environment, Node.js offers limitless possibilities, but I will focus on its uses for web development.

### Local Server

To perform more realistic tests of web applications, it is necessary to have a server to "serve" the pages. Unlike directly accessing an HTML file, the server uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, which allows asynchronous requests to load assets and APIs. It's also very common during development to use live servers for real-time testing.
